## Technical information

### Repository Layout
* **SPEEEduino_v1.0**: EAGLE files for the old SPEEEduino v1.0, which is deprecated
* **SPEEEduino_v1.1**: EAGLE files for thew new SPEEEduino
* **Low Level Library**: The SPEEEduino Low Level Library, which is an Arduino library that provides an easy way to interface with the ESP8266-01 module with the SPEEEduino.
* **docs**: The [github.io homepage](https://sammy0025.github.io/SPEEEduino/) for the SPEEEduino
* **Image Assets**: Image assets for websites related to the SPEEEduino and markdown pages.

### Startup states table
A simplified version of this table is also available on the back of the SPEEEduino v1.1's board.

## Contributing
Contributing to the SPEEEduino Git Repository requires you to have EAGLE 8.4 or newer which supports Managed Libraries.

SPEEEduino primarily uses EAGLE's Managed Libraries made by Sparkfun, but also contain our own custom footprints and SMD component footprints from Cytron.
